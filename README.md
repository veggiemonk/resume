CI/CD pipeline:
Migration from gitosis to gitolite to GitLab in 2 years time with 100+ repository. Running Gitlab and Gitlab CI inside Docker containers (multi servers). Configuring Jenkins (for Java) and Gitlab CI (for Node.js, JavaScript). Preaching the benefits of writing tests made this possible.

Buildman:
Node.js server allowing every team members (technical or not) to build and deploy any applications (web app or java server, version or branch) in one click. This tool also has self­-update and can update other internal tools. The challenge was to configure user access on RedHat Linux with SELinux. Technology Stack: Node.js, Express, git, grunt, terminal.js, SonarQube, RedHat Linux, SSH, BASH.

Analytics:
Setup monitoring/alerting ELK. ElasticSearch (search), Logstash (gather logs), Kibana (visualization), Golang (mail client). Gather logs and statistics from web applications and servers + alerting developers (email only) when a customer has an error.

Presentation:
Teaching web technologies, agile methodology, unit testing, integration tests and e2e tests to others developers.
Presentation to team leaders of git based workflow, merge requests (GitLab), dependency management (Nexus), continuous integration (Jenkins, GitLab CI + Docker), issue tracker (Redmine, GitLab), wiki (MediaWiki, GitLab).

Code quality check:
Install and configure SonarQube (running inside Docker containers) for code quality and technical debt tracking.

Writing reports:
Conferences, meetings, projects requirements analysis. Example of conference report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ahblUs2BaIyEdtQamSX7O9XwRi1GiOZQ4W-G48CooIo/edit?usp=sharing

### Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya 🇪🇸| Researcher

__Sep 2006 – Feb 2007 (6 months) | Barcelona, Spain__

Research over the MPLS protocol:
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a type of data-carrying technique for high-performance telecommunications networks. MPLS is a scalable, protocol-independent transport. In an MPLS network, data packets are assigned labels. Packet-forwarding decisions are made solely on the contents of this label, without the need to examine the packet itself. This allows one to create end-to-end circuits across any type of transport medium, using any protocol. The primary benefit is to eliminate dependence on a particular OSI model data link layer (layer 2) technology,
